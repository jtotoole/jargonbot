deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running jargonbot locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start jargonbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379

## Testing the bot locally

HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE ./bin/hubot -a slack

## Deployment

This is a modified set of instructions based on the [instructions on the Hubot wiki](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md).

- Follow the instructions above to create a hubot locally
- Edit your `Procfile`; it should look something like this:

        web: bin/hubot --adapter slack

- Install [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) if you haven't already.
- `heroku create my-company-slackbot`
- `heroku addons:add redistogo:nano`
- Activate the Hubot service on your ["Team Services"](http://my.slack.com/services/new/hubot) page inside Slack.
- Add the [config variables](#adapter-configuration). For example:

        % heroku config:add HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-1234-5678-91011-00e4dd
        % heroku config:add HEROKU_URL=http://my-company-slackbot.herokuapp.com

- Deploy and start the bot:

        % git push heroku master
        % heroku ps:scale web=1

- Profit!

## Configuration

This adapter uses the following environment variables:

 - `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN` - this is the API token for the Slack user under which you'd like to run jargonbot.

To add or remove your bot from specific channels or private groups, you can use the /kick and /invite slash commands that are built into Slack.

## Adapters

Jargonbot is configured by default for Slack. Adapters are also available for a number of other
chat services -- check [Hubot Adapters][hubot-adapters] to see all available.

you're having issues.
